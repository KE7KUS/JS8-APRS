# JS8Call-APRS
Bi-directional KISS TCP&lt;-->JS8Call UDP routing engine

##Introduction
Many APRS clients make provision for bi-directional processing of APRS packets via KISS over TCP.  JS8Call provides access to a robust weak-signal HF modem via a bi-directional UDP port utilizing JSON.  JS8Call-APRS allows an amateur radio operator to utilize their preferred APRS client and pass APRS traffic over HF using JS8 as the transport.

This software purposes to replace HF APRS using legacy 300-baud AFSK with the more advanced digital modem provided by JS8, giving amateur radio operators more robust APRS performance during remote operations / adverse band conditions.
